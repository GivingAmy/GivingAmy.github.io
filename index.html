              &emsp; So like why isn't it Friday already? I just want to be there with you again. I can't wait to go
              roller blading, eat tacos, and just have a good time again. I'm also looking foward to seeing you again
              that Thursday the 6th and not having to wait super long to see you again. Now Amy I am writing this at
              9:13pm so I am not sure what has happened however if you already talked to Kasey no matter what happended
              I am proud of you for talking to them. It's a bog thing to do and it takes a lot of courage for you to
              tell
              somebody you like them. I am sure we talked about it but I will say this. You're such a great person and
              no
              matter what happenes I will be here and there is no getting rid of me. I want nothing but the best for you
              and I wholeheartly think that Kasey is the best for you. They really seem kind and I judge people very
              harshly
              so for me to say this is a big thing. I see how you feel about them and I see how you just get excited and
              how
              you truly care about them and from what I hear from you they feel the same. No matter what I am here for
              you
              and I will help you however I can. You're still my girly pop and I care about you so whatever you need I
              will
              always be right here. Girly Pops for life!!

              Love Your Girly Pop, <br />
