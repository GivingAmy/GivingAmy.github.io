            &emsp;I really like your little smile/smirk here, like i caught you off gaurd and yet you're still so 
            fucking beautiful. even that pic with Kasey at the party your smile is just so PERFECT and makes me happy.
            Okay so girly pop I just want to say a few things. I know I always have a “few” things to say but as I always
            say I could talk about you for ever. So as always last night I was thinking and my brain was all over the
            place with thoughts. Then I thought about your website and how excited I am to see you. Well all of that got
            me thinking about everything has come to be. I spoke about it in the letter but I don’t think I’ve ever told
            you this little story or part of my life. So yeah we weren’t talking for awhile and everything and yes there
            were a few instances where we would but they felt off to me and that’s why at those moments we didn’t really
            become good friends again. I remember texting you when I was in Florida and things started to feel right
            again. The convos were flowing and I got that feeling in me that I was getting before except this time it
            was even stronger than what we had before and I was fucking eatting that shit up. However that time from when
            started talking to the time we first hung out I was really like not doing good however when we started to 
            hang out and everything I really started to feel better and just overall happier. That's what you do for me 
            girly pop and I am forever greatful for you for all of that and it's why I always say if you need anything you 
            can just ask me because I will do anything for you Amy I don't care what I have going on you're number one to 
            me and you always will be. My pussy pops off for you and I know that everyday you're killing it and kicking ass 
            while being giving as fuck. Im just so proud of you to see how far you've come from when we first met when you 
            were already such an amazing person and now you're even more amazing and I never want this friendship and you 
            being part of my family to ever end. You're so kind, so beautiful, and just so perfect. Keep kicking ass girly 
            pop and remember no matter what I will be on your side to help, encourage, and support you in all of your 
            choices that you make. I can't wait to see you and your kid and Pearl again I am so fucking excited!!! Have a 
            pussy popping dayyyyy and know if you need me you can text me, call me, or whatever you need I will always be 
            here for you. Stay giving and know you're loved by ME!!
