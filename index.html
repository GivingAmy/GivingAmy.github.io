              &emsp;Okay girly pop this is gonna be a little heavy but I think its good for you to hear

              I want you to know that blood doesn't mean someboyds family. It doesnt mean you have some big lifelong
              commitment to them. Family isnt blood, its relationships you have with peopple and take that from this
              family espically. My mom techniclly isn't my bllod related mom my biological mom. Yet shes my mom and the
              only one I want, because of the reationship and bond I have with her. Our father isnt my father because I
              share blood with him, hes my father because he taught me how to be kind, how to control myself, and how to
              be the best person I can be. My sister isnt my sister because we share a parent, shes my sister because
              she played with me as a kid, stood up for me when I needed it, and she was always there to call me ugly.
              Family isnt somthing that can be defined by blood or shared DNA or however that biology shit works. And
              this fmaily right here is a prime example of that. The realtionship you have with Sally is something that
              when I frist met you I admired because its not something thats common anymore. And I know it may feel like
              your family turned their backs on you and they did, however theyre not family. They are just people you
              know and share blood with. It was once said that if you like somebody it means so much more than loving
              somebody because you may say you love your Aunt or something yet you hate them, but if you say you like
              somebody it means more because you can stand them. I know that it may seem like hell right now but you
              need to know that no matter what happens with Justin, your aunt, or ur grandma it doesn't matter. They
              are't real family. They lie, say what they think you want to hear, and are bias. But just because they
              arent in your life or you don't speak to them doesnt mean shit. You have a fmaily right here. Our fthaer,
              my mom, my sister, chippy, roko, and me. And this isn't anything new. I remeber when it was raining hard
              one day at IGA and you had to walk home but didn't have an unbrella. I remember texting our father and
              asking to give you a ride and he didnt hesitate to say yes. Our father doesn't see you as just my friend,
              he sees my sister in you and thinks and cares about you like his own daughter. My mom thinks of you
              whenever he has clothes or anything shes looking to give away. She asks me about you at school all the
              time. I know you dont know my sister too well but I know if you ever needed to talk she would make the
              time for you. This idea I had of AAA for you started as me just helpining you however I could however that
              evloved. Everybody here cares about you, we all want the best for you, and hinestly if we had photos of
              you Im sure they would be hung up next to me and my sister. You're part of this family, you may not live
              here, you dont have any blood relating you to any of us, and you may of not know us for that long. Yet
              you;re family. Ive never seen our father help one of my friends as much as he has for you. We all care
              about you, we all want the best for you, and we will all always be here. Now girly pop I want you to know
              something. I don't just see you as my friend or even my best friend. Ive always seen you as something
              more, and I know what that is, you're family. You're like a sister to me. I will drop whatever I am doing
              to help you, I will fight for you till the end of time. And I want You to know that I love you and no like
              a relationship, but like family. If you ever need anything you call me, text me, or even our fthaer, my
              mom, my sister. You have everyones number not just to sit in your phone but to help you. Being told that
              you need help and you have issues was disrepectful. But you know what, Im fucking proud of you because not
              only did you see somebody about it, you have a journal and you're trying your best and I have seen nothing
              but pure improvement from you and I am so fucking Pussy Popping Proud of you. Justin needs to grow up,
              your aunt needs to see theres two sides to every story and she needs to stay true to what she says, and
              your grandma needs to know that just because somebody seems kind and tells lie, doesnt mean theyre a good
              person, like you. I will always support you , fight with you, and I will always be here for you girly pop
              you're my #1 and you're everything to me. Fuck whatever they say because I know you're going to be
              something they could only dream of. Im proud of you and no matter what you do I know you're a better
              person then them and Sally knows that too. Just know you have this family here for you and we all care a
              lot about you and just know I love you as my girly pop and my everything üíó‚ù§Ô∏è
