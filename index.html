              &emsp;Amy you're the type of person who I know will always be
              there for me and I cannot thank you enough for all you've done for
              me recently. Talking to you about everything going on is just
              super helpful and it really just allows me to calm down and take
              things slowly. I tend to get overwhelmed a lot and whenever I talk
              to you I don't feel that way because every time you talk to me you
              show me that I should focus on my next step and my journey to the
              future and I should not worry about what's out of my control. I
              know that no matter what happenes you will be there and that to me
              means the world. lol not me getting emotional rn. I re-read the two
              letters/notes that you wrote me and I just smiled and they made me 
              happy, like you always do. I love what we have and everything we've 
              built in this friendship and this realtionship. Amy your support
              means the fucking world to me and the video above I watch pretty
              often when I feel sad or something or I want to give up. You say
              "Not around here partner" and that makes me think and want to keep
              going. You motivate me, support me, and make me happy. I had a
              test done and one of the results was to view my dopamine levels
              (the happy chemical). Back in January when we weren't talking it
              was at a low of like 325 when the average is 450ish. Well now just
              10 months later and six months of us being friends and even family
              that test showed it at over 700 and I 100% know it's because of
              you. So when I say you make me happy I have science on my side to
              prove it. But I'm serious Amy, you make me feel safe, wanted, and
              just one of the luckiest people ever to have your support. Even
              Sally when I was texting her for her birthday, she's so kind to me
              and I cannot thank you two enough and I want you two to know that
              if I can ever do anything please just ask me I will do it. I love
              you two and I appreciate all you do for me. Thank you for all the
              support and love. I hope you have a great fucking day and know
              that you're the world to me and I love you. I know Tuesday's are
              your long day so if you need anything or help with anything just
              ask I'll do it!!
