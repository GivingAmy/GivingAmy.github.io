            &emsp;HIII GIRLY POPPP!!! A few things to start, I now have a 
            few more little things for you today. 1) If you click the button 
            below you will see a packet of info for you. Also, I'm sorry if 
            lately I've been a little too much texting you it's just talking 
            to you has been hitting different recently with everything and I 
            just miss you. So when its been a few hours and I text you again 
            I don't mean to be annoying or anything I just miss you and I know
            you're busy and I do try my best not to keep texting and everything
            so I'm sorry if I do it too much I'll try and keep it small but like
            I said I don't mean anything bad and sometimes I just miss you. Okay.
            Next item. So I have your pins, mini mouse statues, and the notes you've
            written me all on my desk with the photo of us in the photobooth just 
            above it and I just want to say it just like calms ne down if I'm doing
            work or something and I see it, think of the times we've popped pussy
            and think of when I will see you again and pop pussy even more. I also
            keep thinking of when I'm going to go fix PEARLLLL and I realized I like
            Pearl more then my sisters car, shes way easier to work on. But all her
            parts will come in today and over the couse of this nex week and a hald
            and I can't wait for them. I hope you have a pussy popping day and let
            me know if you need anything!!! also when are you around Tuesday morning
            bc I may be just a little scared and I may text you but I don't want to
            bother you. (Click the button!!)
            <br><br>
            Love your Girly Pop and Bestie, <br />
