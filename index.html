            &emsp;HI GIRLYYY!!! ITS SMALL JUMPING AMY!!!I had a lot of fun yesterday getting you nails done and
            GIVINGGGG and then
            getting some brunch. The skyzone was a lot of fun I just had to stop because my chest was hurting
            and that could only mean one thing so I stopped for a bit. Overall I had a really good day with you
            and I really missed it all. I am sad that I have to leave today but I am sure that we're going to
            still be giving today and then when I see you again as Mr.Hobbles!! WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MOST GIVINGGGG
            BREAKFAST THIS MORING!!!!!!!<br>
            &emsp;I'd like to just say something thats been on my mind for awhile yesterday, the Kasey thing. I just
            feel
            bad that he thinks that and I don't want to make him uncomftable or anything and I want to talk to him
            but I know that's not right. I just want you to know and maybe you can somehow tell him this. The photo
            was only like him because of the face strcture and the short hair, at quick glance it looked like him. I
            understand why he felt the way he did with the photo and I should have been more careful with what I say
            and what I show to him. I didn't mean it as he is a girl or I still see him as one because I don't and I
            really want to have that converstion with him because I like him, he's cool and a good person. I don't
            want somebody who I consider a friend of mine to be uncomftable or even hurt because of something I said
            and showed. Espically him beacsue I know and I should of been more careful and I took note of that and I
            will be careful, I want him to know I am sorry. Speaking of saying sorry if he thinks I say it because I
            don't want him to get mad at me that's not how I wanted it to come off. I said I was sorry if I ever used
            the wrong pronouns or anything and as a joke after that I said so don't kill me. I said that because it was
            very tence and I didn't know what to do, this is all new and thats not me making an excuse, I want to make
            sure he is comfatable around me and I want him to know I see him as a man, a guy, and not because he says so
            but I actaully see it. Tbh more of a man than Michael. I just hope he knows I am sorry and that I dont mean
            any harm and if theres ever anything he wants to talk to me about I am all ears and I will do whatever I can
            to make him more comftable or whatever it is he needs.<br>
            <br>Love your Girly Pop and Bestie, <br />
