              &emsp;The stars I showed you last night, I didn't just look and say oh wow
              thats cool like I normally do. I looked at them and took the pics and I thought 
              about you and how I got you the earrings and the charm and how you have all the 
              other star things and I really just thought of you and how you're my star. You 
              are my star in the sense that you can make darkness and nothing into something 
              so beautiful and happy. You shine and stand out from everybody and the photo I 
              picked for today shows that. Your smile and the way are in this photo is just 
              giving shining star. It's the reason its your contact photo in my phone because 
              it reminds me of your beautiful smile that shines happiness onto me and my life 
              and I just love seeing it. You are a star Amy and you shine bright and you will 
              be a shining star for many mnay years to come and I know that even when everything 
              may feel dark and like there's nothing I know that I have my girly pop, my star right 
              there to help me and to help herself too. You shine so bright and I am so proud of how
              far you've comme from when I first met you. I am PPP of you Amy and I want you to 
              keep shining and to never give up because you are the best of the best and finding
              somebody like you is very very rare. I know sometimes things may not be straight foward 
              and I want you to know that in life we may not always see the end of the tunnel but 
              we can always see right infront of us and the next step we're going to take and 
              I promise you Amy no matter what I will always be here for every step of your 
              journey and anything that you need please know I'll do it or find a way to help 
              you. Have a GREAT PUSSY POPPING DAY and go be giving as fuck!! Love you girly!!
