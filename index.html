                Hiii girly poppp, as you may of noticted todays website is a very basic and 
                simple, missing a picture and mosty of the stuff above. This is because I want 
                to just focus on this message for today and the picture wasn't working and I 
                can't figure out just why. So as we know yesterday was an eventful day to say 
                the least and once again I cannot thank you enough for being the person you are 
                and being kind and understanding. However if there is anything you want to say 
                please know we can talk about it or whatever you want. We've been friends for 
                awhile and its been one wild ride from IGA all the way to where we are here today.
                We said that we had our ups and downs and wild times and everything however I 
                personally wouldn't consider this a down moment, its not smooth, but its more of 
                a road with a lot of potholes in it making it not seem 100% normal. I just want to 
                tell you that I am sorry for the overreaction yesterday and I want to just tell you 
                that I still really do care about you and you are still my girly pop and my best 
                best friend. I appreciate all you do for me and every second that we talk I cherish 
                them as well. Im sorry Amy for what I caused, making everything uncomftable and odd 
                however I do hope that you can see and understand that this was not something to 
                cause any harm and that I want to be friends with you no matter what and I want to 
                be your bestie girly pop still and I want you in my life. I can't speak for you but 
                thats also why I got scared yesterday and why I asked so many questions because at 
                the end of the day all that matters to me is you and this friendship. We've built a 
                bond that I cherish so much and it's something that no matter what I will always 
                want to have with you. From talking shit about these bicthes and just being giving 
                together. I am sorry for causing this and I do hope we can keep this bond as strong 
                as it is and always has been. We're friends and thats all that matters to me and if 
                there is anything that I need to do for you or you want to talk about or anything 
                please just tell me, I will listen and we can talk about anything. You're my #1 and
                I just want you to be apart of my life because I really can't picture it without you. 
                Sorry this is so long but I hope you have a giving pussy popping day girly pop and I 
                will always be here for you no matter what. You mean a lot to me and you're not even 
                a friend, you're a girly pop, a queen, and somebody who I look up to and is part of 
                my family so again I am sorry for making things like this but I hope you understand 
                everything and if you want to talk or need anything let me know!!

                    can help you edit your resume to each job posting if you
                    want. Its free, I've used it, and there's even their tiktok
                    page if you need help understanding any of it. The first
                    step to getting any job is a strong resume!!
