              &emsp;Giry pop HIIII. Well if i texted you super early to wake you
              I am sorry. I also hope you're feeling better and if you need
              anything just ask. So yes i gave you a mini note/letter yesterday
              well because you're simpily the best. I feel like theres always
              more to talk about. Like the way your face is in the photo, its
              cute and funny. You're like just stunning. My friends like you and
              think you're cool. My parents like you too like thats a first that
              everyone likes somebody I know so it just reassures me that you're
              just the fucking best. Oh yeah and I think you're cool too. You
              help me get that happy chemcial in my braina nd I just smile. I
              tell ya I was looking at photos to choose for this site and all
              the ones I have of us or you or whatever it is they're just
              giving, and your little smile, they way your head leans in or the
              way the filter makes you look funny. Oh girly pop what I'm trying
              to say is you're perfect and that I appreciate all the tiny things
              you do for me that you may not even know you help with. You are my
              number 1, you are the best girly pop ever, and I would give up
              everything I have just to be friends with you and thats not a joke
              Id legit give up everything for you. Or to help you. Im happy that
              at the end of everything we're still friends and just want you to
              know that I appreciate you and if I ever have to give a speech its
              going to start off "I'd like to thank my girly pop for always
              being supportive and just being my #1 supporter". Amy the girly
              pop > Baian I dont have anythig new to add to the packet today as
              I did not have time, I am sorry. Same thing with jobs I just
              didn't have time. But I am working on writing code that will
              search and email me jobs every day for you. I hope you have a
              great pussy popping day and just know Im proud of you and I
              support you and you're doing great!!!
