              always being there and suporting me and thinking of that reall
              just made me feel as if maybe I haven't been a great friend
              recently and I feel like I could ask how you are more or talk
              about you more because I feel sometimes I talk a lot about things
              I do and feel and I feel bad that I don't really ask you how
              you're doing and I'm sorry if I've been a bit one sided. Don't get
              me wrong I do really care about you and I want you to know that no
              matter what it is that you need I am here for you. I just feel
              that maybe I've been one sided and I'm sorry about that girly pop.
              If you ever do need to talk about anything or if you're free and
              you wanna chat just lmk I'm here for you. I care about you a lot
              girl and if there's anything I can do for you please just ask.
