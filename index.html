              &emsp; HI GIRLYYY!! Ahhh just think about it, this time
              next weke I'll be down with you popping pussy!! Now when 
              I am down there I offer you a few things. Fist if Xenya and 
              them won't talk to you we can see how they act when I'm around 
              to see if they're fake or anything. Listen girly pop I know 
              you're amazing and so do you. I'd like to share with you a 
              little something that I'm not sure if I've told you.<br>
              &emsp; We have had our ups and our downs and our fair share 
              of drama. Well back when the stupid IGA drama was going on 
              it was between four people including myself however I only 
              truly cared about one person, you. What you're going through 
              now with Xenya and Ciaira is not fully the same however with
              everything going on you care about everyone but you care more 
              about Kasey because you like him. What I did with the IGA 
              shit was I just did my best to get answers from everyone and 
              I worked with you, the person I cared most about, to make sure 
              that at the end of the day our realtionship stayed strong. What 
              I see going on now with Xenya and everything is just petty high 
              school drama. I think that you know that this has a big chance
              to blow over and I really hope it does. I just want you to know 
              that nothing that has happened is because of you. You have done 
              nothing but be kind and supportive to everybody and you are nothing 
              but fair to everybody and that's one of the top things I LOVE about 
              you. I dont want you to think that you are being a bad person or to 
              feel guilty about anything because you're the most consistent and 
              fair person ever. If somebody is jealous because of something you 
              have I just don't like that and I dont like the selfish behavior. I 
              hope that this all goes away and everyone can be friends again because 
              its not fair to you whos dont nothing but support everybody any way 
              that you could. I care about you girly pop and I want you to know that 
              no mater what happens I will be here for you forever. Call me, text me,
              or whatever you need. Just know that nothing is on you, that you have 
              done everything you can and this is again other people being selfish 
              and because of that they think they can be low-key rude to you which 
              isn't right. Like I said, I protected the realtionships that meant the 
              most to me, ours, and I think that your friendship with everyone is 
              importnat just do what YOU want and what YOU think is best for you. You're
              a strong independent women and I know you're going to make the right 
              choices and no matter what they are I will always be here for you and I 
              will always support you!! Love you girly pop!!

              Love your Girly Pop and Bestie, <br />
