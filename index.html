            &emsp;Hiiii girly popppp. Listen I want to tell you a story that hopefully 
            helps you with whatever you need. When me and my ex broke up it was rough 
            and ofc I still cared and wahted her but yk that wasnt a choice. It really 
            hit me like a truck but I want you to understand that I knew it wasn't my 
            fault. This helped a little with everything but what helped the most was 
            thinking truly about what her intentions were. I kept thinking for days 
            'did she mean this' or 'what did she mean by this' and all the questions 
            that I wanted answers to didnt matter once I asked myself this. Did she 
            really see the future I saw for us? I stopped thinking about what was said 
            and I started to think about what I wanted vs what she wanted. This whole 
            prespective really helped because I saw that she was with me because I was 
            the consistent guy she always wnated, it was her #1 complement of me. With 
            Kasey you need to really think about what he saw you two as and what you saw 
            you two as. Like I mentioned the comment he made, and if hes said anything else 
            to you like that. I think once you can try to see what he wnated its going to 
            help you see everything else more clear. This isnt something to think about for 
            days either, this is what you think about one day when you really feel down and 
            you want those answers. This is the question that helped me the most and I know 
            people can be compliected however, this isn't something that you're meant to know 
            just by talking to him. I answered this question by thinking about the times we 
            spent together and the comments made. It took me a day or two (bc im stupid) but 
            it helped. didnt take everything away but it made the process of understanding and 
            moving on just that much easier. If you need anything call me, text me , email me 
            for all I care. Im here whenever.
            <br>
            <br>Love Your Girly Pop and Bestie<br>
