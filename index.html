              &emsp;#ThrowBackPhoto of the first time I worked on Pearl!!I know two things.
              First you're gonna kill it with your presentation today and second is that I'm 
              going to secure Pearls car parts today. And nothe tape is not ghetto you actually 
              did a great job with it. Now as you know I'm always Pussy Popping Proud of you and
              the things you do but recently it's been hard and Im sorry you have to deal with 
              all of this. I think that as time moves foward hopefully you can forget about it and
              everything will be okay. I'm not saying to stop defneding yourself however like I said
              you can only break things down and explain them so much for people, you can't understand 
              it for them too. Never stop fighting for whats right, never stop defneding yourself but I
              want you to know that it may get pointless to repeat the same shit to people who clearly 
              don't know what "there are two sided to every story" means. No matter what Amy I will 
              support you, in whatever way you need, and I want you to know that I am proud of you 
              and I'm not just proud that you're saying what needs to be said, but I'm proud that 
              you're not giving up. If I can do anything you let me know. And the best way to shut
              everybody up is to prove it to them. I always say how I'm excited to see you suceed and 
              how I can't wait to see you run the world. Well girly pop that day is coming and that's
              the day nobody will laugh at what you make and what you do because I know you're going to
              be the most sucessful people I know. Remember, for everyone laughing now and not taking your
              side, Karmas a Bitch and good things come to those who wait. Ill always be in your corner
              to help you with anything that you need. Now go be GIVINGGGGG AS FUCKKK LIKE THE GIRLY POP
              QUEEN YOU ARE!!!!
              <br /><br />
              Love your Girly Pop and Bestie, <br />
