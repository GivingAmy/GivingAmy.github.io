              &emsp;AMYYYYYYYY HIIIIIIII. First off thank you for being around
              last night and I'm sorry if I dsturbed your dinner run. I would
              like to tell you a quick little story and maybe it's something
              that could help you. So I know everything with Kasey can be hard
              and I haven't had something too similair but I did have a break
              with my ex and we had that odd stage where we wnated to hang out
              or do stuff but it all felt too off. She was always bringing up
              the fact we were on a break and that it doesn't feel right to text
              a lot yet she wanted too. Now our break when it first started was
              just texting less and not being on th ephone till 2am every night.
              However that break really started to happen once she started to do
              the things she said she was working on, family therapy and other
              things that she said were in the way. Once that happened I really
              saw for the first time what a true break was and ngl it was hard
              on me well because I don't like not talking to somebody espically
              my then girlfriend. When we did talk and we did hang out she was
              changed, for the better, and we started off slow. And when I mean
              slow I mean slowwwwww. We tried to limit ourself to maybe 5 hours
              of interaction per week, this included hanging out, text, being on
              the phone. Now she picked this number because that's what worked
              for her to get closer to somebody in her family and she liked how
              it was. So for those five hours a week we talked and talked like
              we just hit it off and never knew eachother. Everything was just
              that much more meaningful because we didn't have much time. As the
              time grew more and more to the point where she was happy with
              herself and the relationship we had built it was all open to do
              whatever, whenever we wanted. The reason I'm telling you this is
              because I think that once Kasey starts to get into therapy and do
              whatever it is he needs to do thats when a lot of the big chnages
              can and most likey will happen. I want you to know that no matter
              what it is that happens there's a reason for it and it may not
              seem very clear as of now because all you keep heraing are the
              same few reasons and things but I know that the chnage for good
              has yet to come. You have patience and you do care about him so I
              kinda see this how my break was at first, not a real break then a
              real one. I know that you're a caring person and the best advice I
              can give you is to say what you have to say. I know this may seem
              rude but it's important for you to say "hey I know a lot is going
              on but I don't think us talking about the same thing over and over
              again is good. I want you to get the help you need and I'm here
              for you just know that it's okay if we don't talk about it, time
              with you is all I want and I just want that time to be enjoyable
              and not talk about anything negative that may trigger you and make
              both of us sad". Just know your voice matters and that I am here
              for you and Kasey anytime you need me. And if you need to talk
              about anything you know you can always just call me or text me.
              Also dont be scared to ask me anything about whatever I tell you
              or if you want to know anything you can just ask. HAVE A PUSSY
