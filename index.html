            &emsp;HII GIRLY POPPPPP!! I love this pic because it's from the first
            time we went out to eat after becoming friends agaian and the memories
            are just giving at Ihop happy hour!!I'm sorry that things got confusing yesterday
            but I am happy that we got it figured out. zi just want you to know that
            NOTHING was because of you any nobody think you're taking advantage of
            me. You're part of this family and that means we do anything for you. All
            of the confusion was just because dad wanted to make sure that everything
            is safe and done right. He doesn't know what your school looks like and he
            want to make sure theres a safe place to do it. Then he was worried what if
            I forgot something. You know how he used to do people's cars he would go to
            their house and if he forgot something he would feel stupid and then have to
            redo the entire thing another day. <br>
            &emsp;You don't know how excited I am to go see you. I feel like its been
            forever and I just can't waittttt!!! I want you to know something, you're
            part of the family and no matter what happens there's a few things that will
            never chnage. You're never going to be seen as taking advantage of things and
            everyone here is here to help no matter what. If something doesn't work the
            first way just know I will find a way to help you. I want you to know Amy
            that I care so much about you and I would never say no to helping you. You're
            not just my best friend either, so whatever it is that you need just know I'm
            going to find a way. Our parents too, they love you and they want nothing but
            the best for you and they want to help you in every possible way. When I was
            on the phone with them they told me to make sure to tell you that they don't
            mean to make things hard for you and that they're sorry. But now we have a
            plan and I can't wait. To see you, Lucy, and work on pearl. We also can do
            the roller skating as well!!! I am just so excited to see you and just know
            however long you need for school work you can take and I will help!! Have a
            great fucking day girly pop and please if you need anything or you're bored
            just text me or call me. I love you, Dad Loves you, and Mom too. You're one
            with this family and we will do ANYTHING for you!!
