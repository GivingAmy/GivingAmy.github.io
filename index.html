            &emsp;HIII GIRLY POPPP!!! A few things to start, I now have a few more little things for you today. 1) If
            you click the button below you will see a packet of info for you. Also, I'm sorry if lately I've been a
            little too much texting you it's just talking to you has been hitting different recently with everything and
            I just miss you. So when its been a few hours and I text you again I don't mean to be annoying or anything I
            just miss you and I know you're busy and I do try my best not to keep texting and everything so I'm sorry if
            I do it too much I'll try and keep it small but like I said I don't mean anything bad and sometimes I just
            miss you. And I understand that you're busy and everything and I know what happens when I really go crazy
            which I know I won't do and I know that because sometimes when I have like 3 text to you that are spaced out
            I tell myself to stop and everything and I just tell myself okay Eddie too much she'll text you when she
            can. It usually works but sometimes Amy I just miss you. For some reason I get scared to say that because I
            think it may show something bad or something. Idk just I get scared to say it sometimes but idk why. I just
            want you to know sometimes I just miss you. Your company and just text with you. I just want you to know
            that I don't mean anything bad or to be annoying when I text you a few times. It's just sometimes I miss you
            and especially when it's been awhile and I'm not saying this because I want you to feel bad. I just wanted
            to tell you what's on my mind, and I want to avoid what's happened before by telling you why. If you want
            me to stop or chnage anything you kmow you can just ask :)
            &emsp;Next item. So I have your pins, minnie mouse statues, and the notes you've written me all on my desk
            with the photo of us in the photo booth just above it and I just want to say it just like calms me down if
            I'm doingwork or something and I see it, think of the times we've popped pussy and think of when I will see
            you again and pop pussy even more. I also keep thinking of when I'm going to go fix PEARL and I realized I
            like Pearl more than my sister's car, she's way easier to work on. But all her parts will come in today and
            over the course of this next week and a half and I can't wait for them. I hope you have a pussy popping day
            and let me know if you need anything!!! Also when are you around Tuesday morning bc I may be just a little
            scared and I may text you but I don't want to bother you. (Click the button!!)

            Love your Girly Pop and Bestie, <br />
